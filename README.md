## PA06 - Programming Assignment 6 - Biovision

### Task

#### Program a viable submission to the 2018 Data Science Bowl Competition: "Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures." 

For preparation, before you start. This is a significant project. Getting just the framework in place to submit a valid kaggle submission may be effortful for you. Start early and work together! 

1. Review all the vision-related python links/code I provided, especially the segmentation demos.

2. Peruse the PDFs I provided on biological image processing, starting with the single paper, then as many chapters of the book as you can get through and find rewarding.

3. Learn about the projcet.
    * Read all about the competition by systematically perusing all the tabs on this site:
    https://datasciencebowl.com/
    * Enjoy a little hype:

    * Watch this more informative video:

    * Read all the sub-sections of the overview tab on this page:
    https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018

4. Download and get comfortable with the data. What are the data formats? How is the mask (label) of the train answers encoded? Don't proceed until you have that figured out! 

5. Review the "Kernels" tab of the below link, as well as the "Discussion" tab for information about other participants' experiences and thoughts on the data and its analysis. 
The competition ended, so we have missed the window to win the $100,000 prize, but that is actually beneficial for being able to see the set of solutions that did well and those that did not.

6. Using your choice of Python environment and libraries, attempt to satisfy the goals of the competition. 
You can use pre-built libraries, or do most from scratch, whichever approach you are interested in.
I suggest trying a threshold based method first.
Check your performance on Kaggle using their submission checker, where you may submit a maximum of 5 entries per day:
    * https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/submit 

7. Submit any related files, *.py, *.ipynb, *.csv, etc. to this repository.
Things you are required to submit include:
    * Scripts and notebooks.
    * CSV submission file, with format, etc defined in the competition rules.
    * `my_working_kaggle_submission.png` a Screenshot of your displayed performance on the Kaggle site, as judged by the automated submission system's grading of your submitted CSV (the one from the previous bullet).
    * `pa06-report.pdf` a PDF report detailing your approach, methods, results, interpretation, and any difficulties encountered. Please include all project members names at the top.
    * Please DO NOT submit the massive data files!

**Have fun!**

### Grading

* Grading will be an aggregate of your performance and demonstration of significant quantity of effort and exploration.
* For this project, you will certainly get a good grade for doing objectively well (given you use your own code, or have built appreciably on another solution).
The competition rules suggest maximizing your https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index is the way to go.
* However, if you demonstrate significant (and reasonably correct) effort into an approach that is experimental, new to you, or generally novel, but don't have great performance, then you can still do very well.  
* Try to get the basic inputs, outputs, and formats in place, so you can actually evaluate your own performance.

------

### Groups

* You can complete this project in optional groups of 2 or 3. 
* Please coordinate your submission so that only one of you submits, while including everyone's names very clearly in the submission, so I don't miss anyone.

------

### Execution
* We'll run this with python3.

### Things to check before submission
* Your name at the top of your source file(s)
* Any source files are in UTF-8, Unix delimited (which if you used solely the CSLinux computers or class OVA VM, should be fine)
* Your program runs in the class VM
* Did you check the program with more input / output test cases than we gave you by generating your own?
